# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#:~:text=Creating%20a%20new%20application).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, ensure you run the scripts in this flow:

### `npm run backend`

This ensures the server is running before starting up the app

### `yarn install`

To run on IOS simulator , ensure you're in the IOS directory(### `cd ios`) before running the pod install command, then run ### `yarn run ios`

### `pod install`

To run on Android simulator , ensure you're in the root directory of the project , then run ### `yarn run android`
